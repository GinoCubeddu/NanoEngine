## What Is The NanoEngine 

**PLEASE NOTE: This Engine IS In Active Development and is not currently suitable for creating games**

The NanoEngine is a 2D C# games engine that was created by [Gino Cubeddu](https://github.com/GinoCubeddu), [Grant Lewis](https://github.com/Glewisguy123) and [Joshua Callis](https://github.com/joshuajordancallis) as part of our second year Games Module at University, and will be built on further by [Gino](https://github.com/GinoCubeddu) and [Josh](https://github.com/joshuajordancallis) in our final year.

The engine itself is built on top of Monogame and uses lots of OOP design patterns such as Singletons, Factory and generics amongst many more. The ultimate aim is to get the Nano Engine fully optimised easy and simple development of 2D games before finally moving onto 3D.
